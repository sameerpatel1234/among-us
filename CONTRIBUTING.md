OpenSuspect is a community-developed game, and contributions are both welcome and appreciated.
In order to maximize the chance your contribution will be accepted, we've provided some guidelines to assist you.
Depending on what area of the game you'd like to help with, the guidelines are different.
The requirements of the programming team are very different than that of the art team for example!

## Programming
1. Find the issue that coroponds to the work you'd like to do
2. Comment on the issue saying that you're going to try implementing it
3. If you're part of the Programming Team on GitHub, assign the issue to yourself
4. If possible, link in the issue to the branch / location where the work will take place (this is optional, and should be skipped for smaller tasks)
5. Include the rough time you think the implementation will take (just a ballpark is fine! are we talking hours, days, weeks?)
6. Once you think you've met the requirements to close the issue, [submit a new Pull Request](https://github.com/opensuspect/opensuspect/compare)
7. Wait for a review _patiently_
8. If the review is successful, **merge**! Congratulations and thank you for contributing!
9. If any issues are identified, correct them and return to step 7.

Please join us in the [OpenSuspect programming chatroom](https://matrix.to/#/#open_sus_programming:matrix.org) if you have any questions, get stuck, or just to hang out and talk about the project.

## Art and Sound Design
In the OpenSuspect Art Team we try to give everyone a chance to participate, which is why for designing all major components we have "auditions", where anyone can submit their sketches, designs and ideas, and once the submission time is up we vote on which design to choose, and stick with it unless the OpenSuspect Leaders have a good reason against it. We than take these designs and once a clear **style guide**, an "instruction" document created by the winner of the audition in collaboration with the Art Team leader, that other contributors follow when they work on final assets.
When it comes to creating final assets for the game, even though the process slightly varies from subject to subject, it is always explained in a README document.

**Steps for new contributors:**
1. Get in Matrix chatrooms: [General Open Suspect Art Chatroom](https://matrix.to/#/!MjTHxhuvjDCtcVgpJY:matrix.org?via=t2bot.io&via=matrix.org&via=privacytools.io) and [Art-nouncements](https://matrix.to/#/!FklGDpSBAYSPiFmBGX:matrix.org?via=matrix.org&via=privacytools.io&via=hacklab.fi)
2. **Check out Art-nouncements to get an idea of what's been done so far**, if you have questions you can ask them in the General Open Suspect Art Chatroom
3. Sign up to OpenSuspect's NextCloud and request access to the Art Team circle
4. Check (Art-nouncements) for active auditions, asset/design request where you can contribute, but always make sure to read Instructions or READMEs
5. Contribute, be firendly and have fun
